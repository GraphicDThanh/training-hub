    # review for a blender

    So, they still had the 17 piece system on seasonal \
    sale for around $49 in the month of November, about \
    half off, but for some reason (call it price gouging) \
    around the second week of December the prices all went \
    up to about anywhere from between $70-$89 for the same \
    system. And the 11 piece system went up around $10 or \
    so in price also from the earlier sale price of $29. \
    So it looks okay, but if you look at the base, the part \
    where the blade locks into place doesnâ€™t look as good \
    as in previous editions from a few years ago, but I \
    plan to be very gentle with it (example, I crush \
    very hard items like beans, ice, rice, etc. in the \
    blender first then pulverize them in the serving size \
    I want in the blender then switch to the whipping \
    blade for a finer flour, and use the cross cutting blade \
    first when making smoothies, then use the flat blade \
    if I need them finer/less pulpy). Special tip when making \
    smoothies, finely cut and freeze the fruits and \
    vegetables (if using spinach-lightly stew soften the \
    spinach then freeze until ready for use-and if making \
    sorbet, use a small to medium sized food processor) \
    that you plan to use that way you can avoid adding so \
    much ice if at all-when making your smoothie. \
    After about a year, the motor was making a funny noise. \
    I called customer service but the warranty expired \
    already, so I had to buy another one. FYI: The overall \
    quality has gone done in these types of products, so \
    they are kind of counting on brand recognition and \
    consumer loyalty to maintain sales. Got it in about \
    two days.
