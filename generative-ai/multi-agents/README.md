# Multi Agents Training
This repository contains the code for training multi-agents system using LangGraph follow [plan](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MbKpfOL28SwjFMueOJEwStXAxfrQnbonCNWDVEk7pP4/edit?tab=t.0)

## Description
This training plan details the development of multi-agent systems using LangGraph. It covers core concepts, advanced techniques, and practical applications, progressing from basic architectures to complex interactions. The curriculum emphasizes hands-on learning through projects, focusing on real-world scenarios. Participants will learn to design, implement, and optimize sophisticated multi-agent systems across various domains.

## Key Objectives
- Understand the core principles and architecture of LangGraph
- Design and implement graph-based multi-agent systems using LangGraph with effective communication protocols between agents
- Implement advanced decision-making algorithms for complex scenarios
- Develop strategies for managing and coordinating large numbers of agents
