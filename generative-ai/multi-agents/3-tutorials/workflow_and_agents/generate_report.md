## Implementation with LangGraph

### Setting Up the Environment

```python
pip install langgraph langchain openai
```

### Defining the Conversation State

```python
from typing import TypedDict, List, Dict
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph

class ConversationState(TypedDict):
    messages: List[Dict[str, str]]
    current_step: str
    context: Dict[str, str]
```

### Creating State Management Functions

```python
def add_message(state: ConversationState, message: Dict[str, str]) -> ConversationState:
    state["messages"].append(message)
    return state

def update_context(state: ConversationState, context_update: Dict[str, str]) -> ConversationState:
    state["context"].update(context_update)
    return state
```

### Implementing Conversation Flow Nodes

```python
def user_input_node(state: ConversationState) -> Dict:
    return {"messages": state["messages"], "next": "process_message"}

def process_message(state: ConversationState) -> Dict:
    messages = state["messages"]
    last_message = messages[-1]

    # LLM processing logic here
    response = llm.predict(messages=messages, context=state["context"])

    state = add_message(state, {"role": "assistant", "content": response})
    return {"state": state, "next": "user_input"}
```

### Building the Graph

```python
workflow = StateGraph(ConversationState)

# Add nodes
workflow.add_node("user_input", user_input_node)
workflow.add_node("process_message", process_message)

# Define edges
workflow.add_edge("user_input", "process_message")
workflow.add_edge("process_message", "user_input")

# Set entry point
workflow.set_entry_point("user_input")
```

### Conversation Handler

```python
class ChatbotHandler:
    def __init__(self):
        self.state = {
            "messages": [],
            "current_step": "user_input",
            "context": {}
        }
        self.graph = workflow.compile()

    def chat(self, user_message: str) -> str:
        self.state = add_message(
            self.state,
            {"role": "user", "content": user_message}
        )

        result = self.graph.invoke(self.state)
        return result["messages"][-1]["content"]
```

### Usage Example

```python
chatbot = ChatbotHandler()

# Start conversation
response = chatbot.chat("Hello, I need help with my investment portfolio")
print(response)

# Continue conversation
response = chatbot.chat("What\'s a good asset allocation strategy?")
print(response)
```

### Error Handling

```python
def safe_process_message(state: ConversationState) -> Dict:
    try:
        return process_message(state)
    except Exception as e:
        error_message = {"role": "assistant", "content": "I apologize, but I encountered an error. Please try again."}
        state = add_message(state, error_message)
        return {"state": state, "next": "user_input"}
```

### Implementing Memory Management

```python
def manage_conversation_history(state: ConversationState, max_messages: int = 10) -> ConversationState:
    if len(state["messages"]) > max_messages:
        state["messages"] = state["messages"][-max_messages:]
