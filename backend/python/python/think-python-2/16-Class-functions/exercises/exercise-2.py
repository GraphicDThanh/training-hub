# Exercise 2
# The datetime module provides time objects that are similar to the Time objects in this chapter,
# but they provide a rich set of methods and operators.
# Read the documentation at http://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html.
#
# Use the datetime module to write a program that gets the current date and prints the day of the week.
# Write a program that takes a birthday as input and prints the user’s age
# and the number of days, hours, minutes and seconds until their next birthday.
# For two people born on different days, there is a day when one is twice as old as the other.
# That’s their Double Day. Write a program that takes two birthdays and computes their Double Day.
# For a little more challenge, write the more general version that computes the day
# when one person is n times older than the other.
