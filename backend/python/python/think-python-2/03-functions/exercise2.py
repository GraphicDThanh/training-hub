# Exercise 2
# A function object is a value you can assign to a variable or pass as an argument. For example, do_twice is a function that takes a function object as an argument and calls it twice:

# def do_twice(f):
#     f()
#     f()
# Hereâ€™s an example that uses do_twice to call a function named print_spam twice.

# def print_spam():
#     print('spam')

# do_twice(print_spam)
# Type this example into a script and test it.
# Modify do_twice so that it takes two arguments, a function object and a value, and calls the function twice, passing the value as an argument.
# Copy the definition of print_twice from earlier in this chapter to your script.
# Use the modified version of do_twice to call print_twice twice, passing 'spam' as an argument.
# Define a new function called do_four that takes a function object and a value and calls the function four times, passing the value as a parameter. There should be only two statements in the body of this function, not four.
